My final project is a notes app

When first opened you should see your notes list as well as a create new list button in the app menu. 
When creating a list it will ask for a name and the descrptition of the list.
A list can be deleted by long clicking the list to be deleted. This should cause the phone to vibrate.
To add items to a list click the list you want to eddit.

By clicking the list you should now see all the items in that list.
To add items to a list click the add button in the top left menu.
When making a new item the app will ask for a name, descprition, and optional date and time which can be set using the menu icons.
Items can be deleted by long clicking the item this should cause the phone to vibrate.
Items will be displayed with the name and date and time selected.
The date and time will be color coded red if past due, orange if 5 days till due, and green otherwise
clicking a item will put up more info on the item selected.

After clicking an item in the item list you should see all information about the item.
Items can be completed by clicking the COMPLETE button on the bottom.
Clicking this button will delete the item from the list aswell as play a ping sound and vibrate the phone.
